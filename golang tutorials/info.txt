Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language
Go can be used to create high-performance applications
Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency
Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007
Go's syntax is similar to C++
Supports concurrency through goroutines and channel
Has automatic garbage collection
Does not support classes and objects
Does not support inheritance

To start using Go, you need two things:

A text editor, like VS Code, to write Go code
A compiler, like GCC, to translate the Go code into a language that the computer will understand


go version
go run .\helloworld.go
go build .\helloworld.go

Go, statements are separated by ending a line (hitting the Enter key) or by a semicolon ";".
Hitting the Enter key adds ";" to the end of the line implicitly (does not show up in the source code).

In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:

int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool- stores values with two states: true or false

var variablename type = value
Note: You always have to specify either type or value (or both)

variablename := value
Note: It is not possible to declare a variable using :=, without assigning a value to it.


In Go, all variables are initialized. 
So, if you declare a variable without an initial value, 
its value will be set to the default value of its type:


 var a string
  var b int
  var c bool

  fmt.Println(a)   ""
  fmt.Println(b)   0
  fmt.Println(c)   flase

var student1 string
  student1 = "John"

Difference Between var and :=

var	                                               
Can be used inside and outside of functions	        
Variable declaration and value assignment
can be done separately	
 
:=

Can only be used inside functions
Variable declaration and value assignment cannot be done separately 
(must be done in the same line)

package main
import ("fmt")

var a int
var b int = 2
var c = 3

func main() {
  a = 1
  fmt.Println(a)
  fmt.Println(b)
  fmt.Println(c)
}


var a, b, c, d int = 1, 3, 5, 7
 var a, b = 6, "Hello"
  c, d := 7, "World!"

Go Variable Declaration in a Block
var (
     a int
     b int = 1
     c string = "hello"
   )

const CONSTNAME type = value

Constant names are usually written in uppercase letters (for easy identification and differentiation from variables)
Constants can be declared both inside and outside of a function

There are two types of constants:
        Typed constants
        Untyped constants

Typed constants are declared with a defined type: 
        package main
        import ("fmt")

        const A int = 1

        func main() {
        fmt.Println(A)
        }

Untyped constants are declared without a type:
        package main
        import ("fmt")

        const A = 1

        func main() {
        fmt.Println(A)
        }

Multiple Constants Declaration
        const (
            A int = 1
            B = 3.14
            C = "Hi!"
        )

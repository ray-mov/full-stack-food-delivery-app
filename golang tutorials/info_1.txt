Go Output Functions
Go has three functions to output text:

Print()
Println()
Printf()

The Print() function prints its arguments with their default format.
 fmt.Print(i)
To print the arguments in new lines, we need to use \n.
fmt.Print(i, "\n")
fmt.Print(j, "\n")

var i,j string = "Hello","World"

  fmt.Print(i, "\n",j)
fmt.Print(i, " ", j)

Print() inserts a space between the arguments if neither are strings:
package main
import ("fmt")

func main() {
  var i,j = 10,20

  fmt.Print(i,j)
}
10 20


The Println() Function
The Println() function is similar to Print() with 
the difference that a whitespace is added between the arguments,
 and a newline is added at the end

package main
import ("fmt")

func main() {
  var i,j string = "Hello","World"

  fmt.Println(i,j)
}
Hello World


The Printf() Function
The Printf() function first formats its argument based on the given formatting verb and then prints them.

Here we will use two formatting verbs:

%v is used to print the value of the arguments
%T is used to print the type of the arguments

package main
import ("fmt")

func main() {
  var i string = "Hello"
  var j int = 15

  fmt.Printf("i has value: %v and type: %T\n", i, i)
  fmt.Printf("j has value: %v and type: %T", j, j)
}

i has value: Hello and type: string
j has value: 15 and type: int
